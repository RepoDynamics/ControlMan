          :class: attention

          These configurations are not extensible, 
          as they are used to define extensions and their caching settings.

          :::{admonition} Local Override
          :class: tip dropdown

          When working with a local clone of the repository on your computer,
          you can override these configurations 
          by creating a `.local_cc_config.yaml` file with the same syntax
          in the root of the repository.
          This file is automatically added to the `.gitignore` file
          and thus will not be tracked by Git 
          or pushed to the remote repository.
          This allows you to maintain a local caching configuration 
          without affecting the remote repository.
