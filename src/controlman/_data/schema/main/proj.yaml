      :::{admonition} Usage
      :class: dropdown note
      This is used to dynamically reference the project name in various places,
      such as documentation website, citation data, README files, and community health files.
      It is also used to derive the [package name](#cc.pkg.name) when not explicitly specified.

      :::{admonition} Best Practices
      :class: dropdown tip
      The project name on itself has no restrictions and can be any valid unicode string.
      However, by default, it is also used to derive the 
      distribution name (cf. [`pkg.name`](#cc.pkg.name))
      and import name (cf. [`pkg.import_name`](#cc.pkg.import_name)) of the package,
      which have stricter naming specifications.
      While you can separately set these to different values,
      for consistency, it is recommended to **choose a project name
      that is as similar as possible to the distribution and import name of the package**.
      This helps to avoid confusion and makes it easier for others to find, install, and use your package.

             a legal entity is created with `name.legal` set to the GitHub username.
             This emits a warning log in the workflow.
          2. The value of `type` in API response is checked;
             if it is `Organization`, a legal entity is created with
             `name.legal` set to the value of `name` in the API response.
          3. `name` is split by the first space character.
             If this results in other than two parts,
             a legal entity is created with `name.legal` set to the value of `name`.
             This emits a warning log in the workflow.
          4. If `name` has only two parts, a natural person is created with `name.first` and `name.last`
             set to the first and last parts of `name`, respectively.
