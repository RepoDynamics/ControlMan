title: Options
description: |
  This section contains a full reference and detailed explanation of all
  available options in your repository's control center.
  These are divided into two categories: **non-extendable** and **extendable** options.
  Non-extendable options are those that are required by {{ pp_meta.name }}
  during workflow initialization, and thus cannot be extended from other repositories.
  These are all stored in YAML files at the root of your repository's control center directory.
  Extendable options, on the other hand, are those that can be freely extended from other repositories,
  and are organized into subdirectories within your repository's control center.
  
  Changing these settings and pushing them to the remote repository's default branch will automatically
  apply the corresponding changes to the entire repository, i.e., branch protection rules will be updated,
  and all corresponding branches will be renamed.
