          For each dependency, add a key-value pair with the key being
          an ID for the dependency (so you can easily reference it elsewhere)
          and the value being a `dependency` object defining the dependency.

          The environment files to write the dependencies to.
          Specifying a conda environment file is required,
          but a pip environment file is optional.
          Multiple tools can share the same environment file(s).
